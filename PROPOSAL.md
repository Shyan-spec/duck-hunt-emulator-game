DUCK HUNT EMULATOR GAME

## Project Description 

My app is called Duck Hunt Emulator. It's a game app for players who want to go back in time and play the popular game in the 80s Duck Hunt. A player can join an online game and try to achieve the highest score, with the score being kept automatically and game results displayed at then end of each round and their total at the end of the game. The player will go againt many duck varients, some stronger and faster than the next, quite the challenge. Users will have the option to play again. In the future, I'd like to add a feature where one player can play against the computer and the data is stored in a database.
